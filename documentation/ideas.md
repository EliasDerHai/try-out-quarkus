## Ideas

There are some ideas on what to add and include. This is not a roadmap, but rather a poorly maintained collection of
brainstormed concepts, which at least should prevent TODOs all over the codebase.

- Testing
    - persistence: integration tests with test-containers
    - domain: faster builds for unit-tests (sub-projects?)
    - controller: use mocked beans for only testing endpoints
    - fix native tests / come up with a clean concept for all test-tasks

- Features
    - add openapi / swagger for REST documentation
    - update OrderState incl. state-machine
    - add Vendor domain
    - add actual gps-service via geocode.maps.co api
    - add authentication
    - write simple FE with solidjs

- Deploy & Infra
    - check dockerization
    - deploy app to kubernetes / azure for learning purpose
    - check options for cicd pipeline (github actions)
