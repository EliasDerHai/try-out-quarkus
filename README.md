# Try-out-quarkus

This is not a serious project, but rather an exercise with following [goals](./documentation/goals.md).

In order to get the project started check out [getting-started](./documentation/getting-started.md).

Once you got the app started you can check out [showcase](./documentation/showcase.md) for some curls and quick
interaction with the rest-api.
